## What is this paper project about?

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a Food Allergy Alert System designed for food delivery applications. Using a user-centered design (UCD) methodology, the research aims to enhance user safety by alerting individuals about potential allergens in food items. The study involves iterative prototype development, usability testing, and feedback from a diverse user base to ensure that the system effectively addresses the needs of individuals with food allergies.

## Methodology

The methodology for developing the *Food Allergy Alert System* involved a structured, user-centered approach to ensure the system's usability and effectiveness in enhancing user safety. This section outlines the key processes used in the research and development phases.

### 1. Participants
Participants for this study were selected to ensure diversity while maintaining control over the testing environment. We classified responses based on age, gender, and professional experience. The participant distribution is as follows:
- **Online Survey**: 101 participants, including 79 males and 22 females, aged between 18 and 55. Most respondents (76%) were aged 18-35, allowing for detailed feedback on system usability from younger, tech-savvy users.
- **In-person Testing**: 18 individuals (10 males, 8 females) participated in prototype testing. They were divided into 4 groups for A/B testing, each group consisting of one male and one female. The testing sessions were conducted in a controlled environment Of Digital Learning Research Lab to ensure consistent results.

### 2. Research Design
The study followed a **mixed-methods research design**, integrating both qualitative and quantitative approaches to evaluate the user experience and feasibility of the food allergy alert system. The research was conducted in iterative cycles to continuously refine the system based on user feedback.

The research was divided into:
- **Pre-survey Phase**: Collected baseline data from participants about their habits related to food delivery and their experience with managing food allergies.
- **Prototype Testing**: Two prototypes (Design A and Design B) were developed and tested. The designs were evaluated through user tasks and feedback.
- **Post-survey Phase**: Participants provided feedback after viewing a video demonstration of the prototype system, helping refine the system's usability and design elements.

### 3. Data Collection
Data collection followed Agile and Waterfall methodologies to gather comprehensive insights from users. This ensured consistency in the presentation of the system's features and user experiences.

**Pre-survey**: Multiple-choice questions were used to understand user profiles, their habits with food delivery apps, their knowledge of food allergies, and current strategies for managing allergies.

**Post-survey**: After viewing a video demonstration of the prototype, participants provided feedback on the following aspects:
- **User Experience**: Feedback on the prototypeâ€™s usability, effectiveness, and satisfaction.
- **Feasibility of Allergy Recommendations**: Evaluation of whether users found the system practical for making informed food choices.
- **Design Perspective**: Collected feedback on the design elements, including the placement of warnings and alerts.
- **User Recommendations**: Gathered suggestions for system improvements through iterative feedback loops.

For **in-person prototype testing**, we employed a **10-question System Usability Scale (SUS)** with a 5-point Likert scale to assess user experience quantitatively. Both **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** prototypes were tested, focusing on Design B. A/B testing was conducted to compare the two designs, using task success rate as a key metric for evaluating usability.

Participants were assigned 5 tasks (e.g., searching for allergy information, adjusting allergen sensitivity, toggling filters). Each task was worth 10 points, and the task success rate measured how accurately users completed these tasks, providing a robust evaluation of the design's effectiveness.

### 4. Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations were strictly adhered to throughout the study. Participants were fully informed about the objectives, procedures, and their rights, including the ability to withdraw from the study at any time. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and personal data confidentiality was maintained by anonymizing all personal identifiers to ensure privacy.

## Results

### 1. Usability Testing
  - #### In-Person Prototype Testing 
      - **System Usability Scale (SUS) Scores:**
        - **Low-fidelity Prototype:** SUS score of **72.4** (Grade B, good acceptability).
        - **High-fidelity Prototype:** SUS score of **85.7** (Grade A+, excellent acceptability).
  - #### A/B Testing
    - **Task Success Rate:**
    - **Design A:** 70%
    - **Design B:** 90%

Design B performed significantly better than Design A, particularly in terms of navigation, clarity of allergen information, and visual appeal. The results indicate that Design B is more user-friendly and effective in ensuring allergen safety.
