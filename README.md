## What is this paper project about?

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a Food Allergy Alert System designed for food delivery applications. Using a user-centered design (UCD) methodology, the research aims to enhance user safety by alerting individuals about potential allergens in food items. The study involves iterative prototype development, usability testing, and feedback from a diverse user base to ensure that the system effectively addresses the needs of individuals with food allergies.

## Methodology
The study used a mixed-methods research approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data through surveys, interviews, and prototype testing. The design followed Ben Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules and Norman's Gulf of Evaluation and Execution for interface design, ensuring an accessible and user-friendly interface.
